# MSc

This repository contains code from the QMUL MSc in Artificial Intelligence

Files named 'Assignment A-D' are from 'Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing' Assignment 1.
A - C are smaller in scale, whereas those named 'Assignment_D...' are a response to the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) Conference 2018 Challenge in English and Arabic.

Files named 'NN_NLP_2...' are from the second assignment using Seq2Seq with Attention for dialogue tagging

Files named 'CV_' are from the Computer Vision module.

Files beginning Audio are speech processing tasks. 

For audio processing, the are a language and person identification task done two ways: using a standard classification CNN and using a Siamese network. The data used are from Kaggle (as a first POC) for the language identification (https://www.kaggle.com/toponowicz/spoken-language-identification ), and then using more realistic data from Common Voice for both language and person identification (using the contributor tags to identify speakers as the same). 

Languages used were English, Spanish, French and German.

A final, personalised task meant that we had to use our own recordings, for which I had myself reading in English, Spanish and French.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, on the language identification task, the Kaggle data got better results. It is ‘cleaner’ and ‘less noisy’. However, the Common Voice data is more ‘real world’ in nature.

You can contribute your own voice to the Common Voice  project at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org and help the data sets grow :-)
